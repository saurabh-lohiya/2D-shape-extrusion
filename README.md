# 2D-shape-extrusion

## Overview
This project focuses on creating, extruding and editing vertices of 2D shapes through mouse events and moving it in 3D space.

## Setup
To install dependencies, `run npm install`.

## How to Run
Execute `vite` to start the project.

## Guide
You can select the mode by selecting on the dropdown on top-right side on window once you start the server.

1. Draw

3. Move  
click and hold on Polygon or The Extruded Polygon You've created in the previous step to select it and press either `x`, `y`, or `z` to move it in plane perpendicular to the axis by moving the cursor.

4. Edit Vertex
